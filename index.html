<li><strong>Cook:</strong> 10 mins</li> 
<li><strong>Total:</strong> 20 mins</li>
<li><strong>Servings:</strong> 4 serving</li>
</ul>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
<li>2 large British Lion eggs, separated</li>
<li>75ml/3floz milk</li>
<li>100g/4oz self raising flour</li>
<li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil for frying</li>
<li>a knob of butter</li> 
</ul>

<h1>Recipe</h1>

<ol>
<li>Place the egg yolks and milk in a large bowl, sift over the flour, caster sugar and salt and mix well. Whisk the egg whites in a clean grease-free bowl until they form soft peaks. Fold into the flour mixture.</li>
<li>Heat a little oil in a large frying pan. Drop two to three large spoonfuls of the pancake mixture into the hot pan and cook for 2 mins until crisp and golden. Turn over and cook for a further 1 min until golden. Transfer to a clean tea towel to keep warm. Cook the remaining batter in the same way to make 12 pancakes.</li> 
<li>Beat the eggs and milk together with plenty of seasoning. Melt the butter in a non-stick pan, add the eggs and cook over a low heat for 2 mins, stirring until the eggs scramble and are cooked to your liking.</li>
<li>To serve, pile two or three warm pancakes on each plate, and serve with the scrambled egg.</li>
</ol>
