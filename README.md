# About

I normally have a lot of time on the weekend, so I like to make pancakes and scrambled eggs.

# Ingredients
- 2 large British Lion eggs, separated
- 75ml/3floz milk
- 100g/4oz self raising flour
- 2 tbsp caster sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil for frying
- a knob of butter

# Recipe
1. Place the egg yolks and milk in a large bowl, sift over the flour, caster sugar and salt and mix well. Whisk the egg whites in a clean grease-free bowl until they form soft peaks. Fold into the flour mixture.
2. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan. Drop two to three large spoonfuls of the pancake mixture into the hot pan and cook for 2 mins until crisp and golden. Turn over and cook for a further 1 min until golden. Transfer to a clean tea towel to keep warm. Cook the remaining batter in the same way to make 12 pancakes 
3. Beat the eggs and milk together with plenty of seasoning. Melt the butter in a non-stick pan, add the eggs and cook over a low heat for 2 mins, stirring until the eggs scramble and are cooked to your liking.
4. To serve, pile two or three warm pancakes on each plate, and serve with the scrambled egg.
